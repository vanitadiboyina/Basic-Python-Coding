 #A simple calculator.
Write a program that works as a simple calculator. It reads two integers (A and B) and a character (Ch).

1. If the character is +, the sum is printed. 
2. If it is -, the difference is printed. 
3. If it is *, the product is printed. 
4. If it is /, the quotient is printed. 
5. If it is %, the remainder is printed. 

Write code to achieve above functionality.
